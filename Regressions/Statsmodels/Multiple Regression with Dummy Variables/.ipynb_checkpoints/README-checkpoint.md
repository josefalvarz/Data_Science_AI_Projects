- This folder contains a Multiple Linear Regression file about the prediction of houses using dummy variables. This model is more advanced because I've been introduced to a very important topic such as the inclusion of Dummy variables in our models. The model achieved a 91% score, which is really great and demostrated the great use of Dummies.

- Detailed comments can be found in the file.
