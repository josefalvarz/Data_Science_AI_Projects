- This folder contains all the assignments that I've done in the regression section of my Data Science Bootcamp. It includes files such as Simple Linear Regression for predicting GPA to Multiple Linear Regressions for predicting House prices. This folder contains important topics that are very useful for doing regressions in real life such as Feature Scaling and Split Data. 

- This folder also comes with all the datasets that I've trained each model with.

- Detailed comments are inside each file.
